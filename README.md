# Simple Programs

> Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability––Edsger W. Dijkstra

A collection of short coding projects, inspired from fun programming topics.

## Getting Started

To run the programs, you will need to have installed Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager) on your local machine.

Programs are written in TypeScript. For the latest version, run:

    npm install -g typescript

To run any simple program, first compile into JavaScript using

    tsc [name_of_simple_program].ts

And then run:

    node [name_of_simple_program].js
